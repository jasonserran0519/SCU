# Advanced Programming
This class is an extension of COEN 10 as it builds on the foundations, and introduced me to more advanced coding techniques, with a formal introduction to data structures

## Content of Labs
The class introduced me more to different type specifiers, and some new structures. This includes pointers, using longs vs ints, arrays, and moving into linked lists.
We also got exposure to using files, and file commands, and implementing recursion to solve problems, that would be hard/ less efficient using iteration.
Other things we were introduced is the idea of using header files to store all the necessary libraries and function definitions.
