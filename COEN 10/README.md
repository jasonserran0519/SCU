# Introduction to Programming
In this class, we focused on the basic programming structures, loops, and practices. SOme of the lab work we made was in PHP to build a website, while the rest of the labs focused on building a boba system using C.

## PHP
The first few labs dealt with some web development. This includes building a lottery machine game of guessing the random numbers, and a math game for anyone to play. 

## schedule.c 
All of the different implementations of schedule.c dealt with adding functionality to a boba system that could be used by any industry; this includes adding your phone number, your name, and the amount of boba drinks you would like to order.
