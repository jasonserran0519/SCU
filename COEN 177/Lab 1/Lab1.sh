# Title: Lab1 â€“ Unix/Linux Commands and Basic Shell Programming
# Description: This program computes the area of a triangle and area of a circle <you should
# 
# With this program. It first checks if the user running the program is me (Jserrano). If it is not me, the program will not run.
# After verifying, my program will ask for measurements of width and height of there rectangle. Given the measurements the program will compute the area.
# After this, the program will do the same for a circle, given its radius by the user. Once given, the program will return the area of the circle.
