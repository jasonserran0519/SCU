# Title: Lab5 â€“ Synchronization using semaphores, Lock and condition variables 
# Description: This file documents all of the observations for the Lab5 experiments

Step1:
After running the program, it showed threads moving in and out of critical sections. However the order of threads going in the critical section were out of order.
But, the output of threads was in order. 

Step2: 
The program essentially has the same funtionality as Step1 with the Semaphore implimentation. This time it is used with mutex lock. 

Step3:
The program uses semaphores and a buffer to solve the producer consumer problem.
I did notice that program would continue forever.

Step4:
The program has similar functionality to step 3, but with condition variables.
