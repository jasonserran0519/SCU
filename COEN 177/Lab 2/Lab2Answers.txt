Lab 2

1-3: In step 3, I noticed the program would not run if there wasn't a value being 
passed into the program.

4:  The higher the number for the delays, the slower the program runs. 
500 input resulted in a quick execution of the code. 

5: My thought process was to create one Parent Process that has 2 child processes. 
Those child processes then have 2 child processes of there own. The end result leads
to 1 Parent 2 Children and 4 GrandChildren. This equals 7 processes.

6: The processes for threads was similar but I needed to make a seperate function for
the threads.

7: I had some initial trouble with the code due to a spelling mistake, but I got it sorted out.
