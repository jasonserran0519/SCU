Title: Lab5 â€“ Synchronization using semaphores, Lock and condition variables Description: This file documents all of the observations for the Lab5 experiments

Steps to completing the assignment:

1. Opened the vmware application with:
	- setup vmware
	- vmware &
2. Login in as: root with the password I set

3. Started the file transfer with:
	-  in VM put input: '# tcpd fp /usr/bin/in.ftpd &'
	-  in VM put: '# ifconfig'
	- in ternminal "host machine": 'ftp XXX.XX.XX.XXX' (your IP Address)

4. Run following commands in host machine:
	- $ cd  /usr/srs/kernel
	- $ get proc.c
	from this, proc.c wil be placed in the main host machine to be able to edit. Once the changes have been done. Save the file

5. Changes in file 
	- The changes can be found in the function pick_process()
	- due to the function being responsible for choosing which processes to use
	- The change I did was to ensure that 50% of the time, the priority would get skipped. 
	- This allows for fairness among the processes. 
	- I did this by making a random int Number choose between 0 and 20. If the the number is less that 10, the priority process will be choosen. 


6. Put the file back into the virtual machine with '$ put proc.c' in the host machine 
7. In virtual machine 
	- '# cd /usr/src'  opens directory in the OS
	- '# make world' recompiles the kernel
8. View results
