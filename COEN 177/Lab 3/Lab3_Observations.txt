Lab 3 Observations

Step 1: 
The code in step 1 would return the files in my Lab3 directory.

Step2:
The Program would return "Writer on the upstream end of the pipe
 -> 1 Argument (2 arguments if I gave an argument)
Below that, the program would return "Reader on the downstream end of the pipe ./S t e p 2 (followed by input given)

Step 3: 
Modified Program of Step 2

Step 4: 
Step 4 took some timne to figure out but after finishing, it printed the Lab3 directory

Step5:
Step 5 would cycle between producer and consumer where the producer (The parent process) would
send messages to a pipe that would later send to buffer. The consumer would print the message in the buffer.
It would then cycle back to the pipe where the pipe would output as much of the message from the producer
into the buffer. This was done until the message was fully printed out by the consumer

Step6:
The issue was that there needed to be a pthread command when compiling the program. The result was the creation of 10 threads.
