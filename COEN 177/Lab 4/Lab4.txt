# Title: Lab4 â€“ pthreads
# Description: This program is used for the documentation of lab 4

Step 1:
On first compilation, the program does not compile due to there being a 
"cannot find -lp" error and "error: ld returned 1 exit status". To fix it
I added a -lpthread command when compiling my code. this resulted in a bunch of trheads being returned at random.
However when running the program while streaming a youtube video, the threads returned in an orderly fashion and not at random.
The go() function returns variables that are exclusive per thread as it generates the IDs of each thread,
while the i local varaible is a shared state variable as it's responsible for being the number of threads created. 

Step 2:
The possible outcomes from deleting pthread join is that the threads don't wait for eachother to execute.
This results in threads printing out of order and potentially not clossing until the main thread is done. 

Step 3:
The matrix worked well, I found out that if srand(time) is stated time it creates two seeds of random generators that will actually generate the same number. 
I fixed the issue by only having one srand.
